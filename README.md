# INTRO....

* Virtual reality is a simulated 3D environment that enables users to explore and interact with a virtual surrounding in a way that approximates reality, as it is perceived through the users' senses.
* Currently, standard virtual reality systems use either virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, sounds and other     sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world,  move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. 

# VR TYPES...

* However, the technology has come a long way in providing realistic sensory engagement and shows promise for business use in a number of industries.
* VR systems can vary significantly from one to the next, depending on their purpose and the technology used, although they generally fall into one of the following three categories:
* Non-immersive. This type of VR typically refers to a 3D simulated environment that's accessed through a computer screen. The environment might also generate sound, depending on the program. The user has some control over the virtual environment using a keyboard, mouse or other device, but the environment does not directly interact with the user. A video game is a good example of non-immersive VR, as is a website that enables a user to design a room's decor.
* Semi-immersive. This type of VR offers a partial virtual experience that's accessed through a computer screen or some type of glasses or headset. It focuses primarily on the visual 3D aspect of virtual reality and does not incorporate physical movement in the way that full immersion does. A common example of semi-immersive VR is the flight simulator, which is used by airlines and militaries to train their pilots.
* Fully immersive. This type of VR delivers the greatest level of virtual reality, completely immersing the user in the simulated 3D world. It incorporates sight, sound and, in some cases, touch. There have even been some experiments with the addition of smell. Users wear special equipment such as helmets, goggles or gloves and are able to fully interact with the environment. The environment might also incorporate such equipment as treadmills or stationary bicycles to provide users with the experience of moving through the 3D space. Fully immersive VR technology is a field still in its infancy, but it has made important inroads into the gaming industry and to some extent the healthcare industry, and it's generating a great deal of interest in others.

# How can virtual reality be used?
* Virtual reality is often associated with gaming because the industry has been at the forefront of the VR effort, as evidenced by the popularity of products such as Beat Saber, Minecraft VR and Skyrim VR. Even so, there has been a growing interest in the potential of VR across a number of other areas:

* Training. VR makes it possible to train personnel safely, efficiently and cost-effectively. It can be especially beneficial to those in high-risk or highly specialized positions, such as firefighters, EMTs, police officers, soldiers, surgeons or other medical personnel.
Education. VR offers educational institutions new methods for teaching and learning. It can provide students with intimate insights into environments that are typically inaccessible, while keeping them engaged in the learning process. For example, a history teacher might use VR to show students firsthand what life was like in ancient Greece or China.
* Healthcare. VR has the potential to benefit individuals across the healthcare industry, including patients, practitioners and researchers. For example, VR shows promise in treating disorders such as anorexia, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). On the other hand, doctors might be able to use VR when working with the patients to explain diagnoses or treatment options. VR could also benefit individuals who are physically limited in some way.
Retail. VR has already made some inroads into retail, but the industry has only scratched the surface. With the right apps, customers will be able to try on clothes, decorate their homes, experiment with hair styles, test eye glasses and in general make more informed decisions about products and services.
Real estate. VR can benefit real estate in a number of ways. For example, architects can show detailed plans in 3D; home buyers can tour homes virtually; building engineers can tour HVAC systems; and home owners can see what their remodels would look like.
* Entertainment. VR has already had an impact on gaming, but it also promises to transform the film and television industries, providing viewers with an immersive experience that puts them right into the scene. VR could also lead to an entire industry in virtual tourism, making it possible for people to experience places that they might never be able to see in-person.
